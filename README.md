The repository includes the necessary files for the Trifork Developer Test. 
The principal file is `repository_app.py`, which has the class `RepositoryApp` to 
extract and compute the requested data. This class has three main methods for 
providing the solutions to the three questions posed. \
The repository also contains a _python notebook_ that explains how the class
works.
